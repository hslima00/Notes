## PCM Phase Change Memory

It has a glass like material that has 2 modes: amorphous and crystalline. Changing the mode also changes the electrical resistivity. Modes change by heating the material.

### Pros and Cons 

- Requires current pulses
- Expected to scale to 9nm
- Can store more bits 
- Can have more than one bit per cell
- Consumes less energy at idle, but consumes more energy if changed 
- Read Latency lower than DRAM $2^{11}$ vs $2^9$ (PCM vs DRAM)
- Write Latency is much worse than DRAM, about 12x slower


Non-Volatile- Keeps the value 


## STT-MRAM Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM

You give current to change the magnetic field orientation.
