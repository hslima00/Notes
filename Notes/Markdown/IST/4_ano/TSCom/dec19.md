## Domain Specific Accelerators DSA

We have specialized hardware, for example, washing machines etc 

Then we have a GPP, general porpose processor 

We are now moving back to a middle position between SH and GPP, the Specific Domain. 

DSA requires less power to process stuff, but the memory is lower.


There are different methods to achieve DSA:

1. Expand the instructions of a GPP to a specific domain 
2.
