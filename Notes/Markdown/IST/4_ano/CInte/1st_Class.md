# What is Computation Intelligence?

- 1992: Jim Bezdek 

Jin Bezdeck suggested IEEE - Largest Engeniering in the World the use of the name of "Computational Intelligence" in the upfollowing conferences about Intelligent Systems.

IEEE CIS(Computation Intelligence Society)

Computational Intelligence according the professor: "Mimicking nature for problem solving".

!!! danger "Artificial Intelligence vs Computational Intelligence" 
    Intersects Artificial Intelligence goals but now its techniques.
 

!!! note "Machine Learning" 
    - Some Intersection
    - but ML is mostly based on blackbox approaches for data manipulation 

!!! tip "Research Areas" 
    Main 3:
    - Artificial Neural Networks
    - Fuzzy Systems 
    - Evolutionary computation
    But also: 
    - Swarm Inteligente 
    - Simulated Annealing 

MIxing areas: Hybrid Systems 

Techniques like NN, FL, EA (this techniques are totally different) are used in modeling systems where it is impossible do model something mathematically. 

# Neural Networks

!!! bug "-INSERT A PIC HERE-"

- NN can learn! 
  - Learn by example
  - The NN must be told the expected value from a set of example inputs.
- Given enough examples, the NN is able to learn and generalize the outputs for unforeseen inputs

NN is good preforming tasks trivial to humans but difficult to other computational techniques such as handwritten character recognition.


!!! example 
    NN application examples: 

    - Object detection; Speech recognition; --- --- -- - - -- -

# Evolutionary Algorithms and Swarm Intelligence

- Primary goal: Optimization
- Metaheuristic optimization algorithms 
- Inspired by biological evolution and or biological systems 

# Fuzzy Systems 

!!! bug "exemplo do prof"

Instead of a binary logic, we have **multivalued logic** that allowws intermediate values to be defnined between conventional evaluations like yes/no, true/false, black/white.

# Data and What to do With it 

"We are drowning in data... but starving for knowledge"

## Pattern Information

Goal: Obtain Knowledge

Input Data -> Data Preprocessing -> Data Mining -> Post Processing 

### Clustering 

**Categorization in the abbsence of labels**
- Find groups in the data that share simillar patterns 

# Data Types 
- Raw data streams 
- Time series data 
- Spatial data 
- multimedia
- text 
- the world wide web
- structure data 
- etc.

## Attribute (Freature) Types 
- NOminal
- Binary/Boolean
  - Convention: assign 1 to most important outcome (e.g HIV positive)
- Ordinal
- Numerical
  - quantity 
  - interval
  - ratio
- Discrete Attributes
  - Countable or Uncountable
- Continuos Attributes

# Basic Statistical Descriptions of Data 

- Motivation
- Mean
- Median
- Mode
- EMpirical Formula

## Measiring the dispersion of data 

- Quartiles
- Inter quartile range
- FIve number summary
- boxplot
- outlier
- Vaeiance 
- Stander deviation

# Data Preprocessing 

!!! important 

- Data cleaning 
  - Fill in missing values, smooth nousy data, identify or remove outliers 
- Data integration
- Data reduction 
- Data transformation and data discretization 

## Data Cleaning 

Data is dirty, due to faulty instruments, humam or computer error and need to be clean.


!!! danger 
    Dimensions is the amount of attributes that we have
