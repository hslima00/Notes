Or is also called the step function.

$s$ is called activation

$g(.)$ is called the activation function 

$x$ are inputs

$w_k$ are the weights.

This kind of NN is not very used because it only outputs binary. Therefore it can only do classification tasks. 

## Rosenblatt algorithm 

Algorithm used to train the weigths of the McCulloch & Pitts Model.
